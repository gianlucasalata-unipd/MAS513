# MAS513-Advanced Robotics project
This paper addresses the application of a non contact sensor for the detection of rolling-element bearing damage in induction machines; in particular using a Radar to detect vibrations of motor's shaft.

## Experimental Setup Hardware
### Vibration Simulator( DyLab MVS-510)
The simulator is composed by a Siemens 2 polar couples induction motor (1) driven by a variable frequency drive (2) and connected to a main shaft which is anchored to the base through multiple bearings (4). For each shaft mounts are present 3 bearing slots but only the central one is the working one. 2 healthy bearings, 1 outer race defected  and 1 inner race defected bearing are available; swapping these bearings in the central positiion of the mounts is possible to simualte every working condition, for example: healthy bearings, only 1 defected or shaft with multple defects. 
A magnetic brake, working as a load, is coupled to the main shaft through a reduction gearbox
